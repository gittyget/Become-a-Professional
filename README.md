# Dog Grooming Is Expensive : Learn To Do It Yourself!
## Why Do It Yourself?
- Caring for a dog is a lot of work as it is; you already need to pay for food, vet vistis, a crate or bed, things to keep them entertained, AND for regular grooming.
- Full Servie Grooming - which includes bath, hair trim, nail trim, ear and teeth cleaning - differs by dog size and breed. My 5lbs dog costs $70 for a full service, and I used to do those every other month since her hair grows and she starts to smell strongly of dog pretty fast.
- A regular nail trim costs $16 at [PetSmart](https://services.petsmart.com), and a nail trim and grind (so that the nails stay short longer) costs $20. Doing that every month will eventually pile up to be a lot of money spent.
- Learning to groom your dog (or pet in general) could save you lots of money in the long run!
